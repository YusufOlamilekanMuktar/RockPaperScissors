# RockPaperScissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game, usually played between two people (in this case, its against the .py random module), in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. Well, its a very common game so there no need for me to waste the English letters in trying to explain.......have fun editing and improving the code.
